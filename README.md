# skpws-0.6.1

sketchpaws new version 2! For the past couple weeks, I've been working on a game called Sketchpaws based off the Magic Cat Academy games. Blah blah blah. You draw shapes as a cat wizard.

This game is not finished, hence the version. This game is only public because I need to upload it to Github Pages to get the HTML5 ver. working. The EXE is too big. :/

Credits: Main Character sprites "traced" off Magic Cat Academy 1 and 2. BGM Composed by Douglas Holmquist Menu Music: Inverted World by ARForest (Rotaeno OST)

THIS IS NOT A COMMERCIAL PROJECT. THIS IS A PRIVATE PROJECT.
